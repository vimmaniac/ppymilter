= Pure Python Milter Wiki Page =

PpyMilter is a milter protocol implementation (for sendmail, postfix, etc) that is written entirely in python.  It does not depend on libmilter.a but rather understands the milter protocol and talks directly to your MTA (over a socket).

= Quick Example =
import asyncore
import asyncppymilterserver
import ppymilter

class MyHandler(ppymilter.PpyMilter):
  def OnConnect(...):
    print "MTA received a connection!"

asyncppymilterserver.AsyncPpyMilterServer(port, MyHandler)
asyncore.loop()
